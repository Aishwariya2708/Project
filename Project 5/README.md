# Secure File Transfer Simulation

# Technology: C Programming (Win32 SDK, DLL) 

# Project Overview :

A Windows-based simulation project that demonstrates the concept of cryptography and system-level programming using the Win32 SDK. 

The project implements Caesar Cipher and XOR Cipher for encryption/decryption and performs file handling via Windows system calls instead of standard C library functions. 

The cryptographic logic is modularized into a Dynamic Link Library (DLL), making the functionality reusable by multiple client applications. 

This project showcases low-level programming, system calls, and DLL development in a practical and secure context. 

# Key Features :

# * File-based Encryption & Decryption
◦ Supports secure encryption/decryption of text files. 

# * Multiple Algorithms Implemented
◦ Caesar Cipher (character shift-based substitution) 
◦ XOR Cipher (bitwise XOR with user-defined key) 

# * System-Level File Handling
◦ Uses Win32 SDK APIs (CreateFile, ReadFile, WriteFile, CloseHandle) instead of high-level C functions. 

# * DLL Integration
◦ Exported reusable functions through a custom DLL. 
◦ Client applications dynamically load and use encryption/decryption services. 

# * Low-Level Programming Practice
◦ Worked extensively with pointers, buffers, and string processing. 
◦ Strengthened debugging skills with Visual Studio and Windows tools.

# Skills Highlighted 

* Proficiency in C programming and Win32 SDK system programming.
  
* Experience in DLL creation, exporting/importing functions, and client integration.
  
* Strong understanding of Windows API for file I/O and process handling.
  
* Practical knowledge of cryptographic techniques (Caesar & XOR cipher).
  
* Hands-on with modular project development and secure file transfer concepts.

  # Example :
  
 Enter the name of original file:
 Input.txt

Enter the name of new Encrypted  file:
new.txt

Enter the key for Encryption:
3
11

Enter the name of Encrypted file:
new.txt

Enter the name of new Decrypted file:
Output.txt

Enter the key for Decryption:
3
11
